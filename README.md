# model-index - maintain a source of truth for ML models and results

`model-index` has two goals:
- Make it easy to maintain a source-of-truth index of Machine Learning models and results 
- Browse this source-of-truth index on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)

The main design principle of `model-index` is flexibility. You can store your model metadata however is the
most convenient for you - as JSONs, YAMLs or as annotations inside markdown. `model-index` provides a convenient
way to collect all this metadata into a single file that's browsable, searchable and comparable.

You can use this library locally or choose to upload the metadata to [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)
to have your library featured on the website.
